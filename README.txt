This is the practical assignment from Mick van Hulst, a student following the subject 'Data Mining', at the university of Rotterdam.
In this directory you will find several files/folders.

Folders
- The 'data' folder contains the data for the assignments. The python scripts will refer to these folders as well.
- The 'results' folder contains results from the algorithms (i.e. the generated tree from the decision tree algorithm, a 3d graph displaying the result of dbscan and the output of the dbscan algorithm in CSV format).

Python scripts
- 'process_data.py' contains a script that processes the data files for the supervised learning algorithms (i.e. bayesian & decision tree).
- 'bayesian.py' contains the algorithm for the Naive Bayes classifier. Note that I also created an algorithm called the 'Gaussian Bayesian classifier' because I thought we had to make our algorithms for continuous data as well (after creating the algorithm I found out that this was not a prerequisite).
- 'dbscan.py' contains the algorithm for the dbscan method.
- 'decision_tree.py' contains the algorithm for the decision tree method.
