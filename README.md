# ID3 Decision Tree classifier
This is a project created by the students Yoeri van Bruchem and Mick van Hulst for the course Data Mining at the Radboud University.

# How to
1. Clone the repo on your local pc.
2. Open a terminal and run: 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' (pip3 is used for Python 3)
3. (optional*)Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
4. Run 'main.py' using Python3. 

# Important
*This is if you'd like the algorithm to chart the tree itself. This requires some manual input in the code by the user. The user has to add the path to his GraphViz folder in the code (see variable 'path' in main.py). Keep in mind
that the function to draw the tree is commented by default.
